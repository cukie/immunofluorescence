java bulk imaging analysis of pathological immunofluourescent images

During the Summer of 2014 - collaboration with Dr. Franco-Barraza at Fox Chase Cancer Center to write a program that conducts digital quantitative and qualitative analysis in bulk. The developed algorithm batch-processes large sets of microscopic images, exports a corresponding database of resulting images representative of individual and combined color values images, and exports a full set of representative processed image results which match pre-set masks. The program also provides quantitative data such as specific and combinatorial customized color locations, intensities, averages, areas, and more, which can then be processed by a biostatistician. In this particular work, the output is being used to assess clinical relevance of particular protein marker levels in a large cohort of human pancreatic and kidney cancers.
